# Wasatch.soccer

This is the codebase that currently powers https://www.wasatch.soccer.

If you'd like to run this on your own (and please do!), you'll need the following:

- Backend hosting, which is powered by Strapi. Node 18 required. I am using Heroku.
- Frontend hosting, which is powered by Next.js. Node 18 required. I recommend Vercel.
- Postres database. I'm using bit.io.
- Redis instance. I'm using upstash.com.

Everything is templatized except theme colors and logos, which I'll get around to at some point.
Locations for those changes include:

- /frontend/.env.default > /frontend/.env
- /backend/.env.example > /backend/.env

If you'd like to change theme colors and logs (and you should â€” please don't impersonate our
website), that's easy, too.

- /frontend/src/app/globals.css
- /frontend/public/\*(png|webmanifest)
- /frontend/src/logo-black.png (for light mode)
- /frontend/src/logo-white.png (for dark mode)

Given those constraints above, I'd recommend a fork if you're looking to run this, but I will
be working on making those things a bit simpler to maintain and deploy.

Someday this might evolve into a multi-site architecture. Keep your eyes peeled for that.
